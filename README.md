##Chapter snapshot for "Drupal 8 Site Building"

This is a periodic database and file snapshot for the BuildAModule video collection __Drupal 8 Site Building__. This is useful for when you want to start at a certain chapter with your site pre-filled.

There is a separate resource pack download that comes with this collection, and you can follow the instructions in the __Chapter Snapshots__ folder for a detailed explanation on how to use this repository. Here are the short instructions:

1. Backup your project.
1. Each chapter corresponds to a branch. The branch name is __snapshot-8-[minorVersionOfDrupal]-[chapterNumber]__. Select the branch you want. This will be a snapshot that matches with the site at the beginning of the chapter.
1. Download the ZIP file for that branch and extract the files.
1. Replace your Drupal 8 directory with the __site__ folder (rename the directory as needed)
1. Import the __database.sql__ to replace your database.

Good luck with the learning!
